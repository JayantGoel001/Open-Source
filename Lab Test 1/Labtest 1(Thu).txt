1.  Write a function that takes as input two matrices A and B of integers and perform the following operations:[ use numpy ]
	a) Check if the matrix A's upper triangular elements are even  if not then convert it to even numbers.  (3 Marks)
	b) Check if the matrix B 's diagonal elements are armstrong numbers( An Armstrong number is an n-digit number that is equal to the sum 
                       of the nth powers of its digits)
                 if yes then replace them with the difference of the number with the minimum of all the elements in the matrix.  (3 marks)        
        c) Display the updated matrices A and B. ( 2 Marks)
	d) Multiply updated matrix A and B. (if they cannot be multiplied print the statement "Operation cannot be performed") (2 Marks)
	e) Print       of the resultant matrix of step (d). (3 Marks)
